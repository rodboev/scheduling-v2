Filter current clusters for closest points and minimum breaks between locations, pick enough to fill 8 hours of duration (each service location plus at least 15 min between them)
Start each cluster with the location closest to any technician's address, use tech name for those services
Show previous tech name too
Calculate distance between locations based on based on 15mph (use Vroom later)
Drop rest of locations if shift is over 8 hours
Re-generate clusters and find cloest points again
